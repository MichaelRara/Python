# Python video processing project

This is my video processing project.
The goal of the project was to upgrade quality of a video captured by a high-speed camera.
I used OpenCV library to denoise the record.
I used gradient method to detect edges in video.
I used 2D discrete convolution to make video sharper over edges.

# Algorithm
I cut an original record into individual frames.
I use OpenCV library to denoise every frame.
I use gradient method to detect edges in every frame.
I use 2D discrete convolution to make frames sharper over edges.
I use these upgraded frames to compile a new upgraded video!
