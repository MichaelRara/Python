# Python - video processing project

This is my video processing project.
The goal of the project was to upgrade quality of a video captured by a high-speed camera.
I used OpenCV library to denoise the record.
I used gradient method to detect edges in video.
I used 2D discrete convolution to make video sharper over edges.

# Algorithm
I cut an original record into individual frames.
I use OpenCV library to denoise every frame.
I use gradient method to detect edges in every frame.
I use 2D discrete convolution to make frames sharper over edges.
I use these upgraded frames to compile a new upgraded video!

# Input and results
Here is the original record https://drive.google.com/open?id=189ba4jAzM19Q2uReBQJerO1rcCaVKRRj
Here is the original record where edges are visualized https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rrH2w52U83FGjj6udQf_nn4CpEdOpUSb
Here is the upgraded record https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OSMThMO7fcFEg9sM4pbjrSceCGYA-Lgh. 
You can see the quality of a upgraded record is much better!
